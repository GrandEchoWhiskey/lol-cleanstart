# Leauge of Legends - Clean Start
This batch file helps you to run leauge of legends when the tasks are not quite terminated.

If you still have problems try to rewrite this line:
```batch
start "" "C:\Riot Games\Riot Client\RiotClientServices.exe" --launch-product=league_of_legends --launch-patchline=live
```
Instead of `"C:\Riot Games\Riot Client\RiotClientServices.exe" --launch-product=league_of_legends --launch-patchline=live` paste in your run command from the properties of Leauge of Legends Client.
